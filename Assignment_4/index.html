	<h2>Variables Used</h2>
	
	<p>Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Annual greenhouse gas emissions by activity and by region</p> 
	<p>Mitigation: Forest and Carbon Footprint</p>
	<p>IMF-Adapted ND-GAIN Index: Measures a country’s current vulnerability to climate disruptions and assesses a country's readiness</p>



    <h2>Proposition</h2>

		<section>
      <p>Developing regions like Africa contribute less than 20% of GHG gases contributing to the global climate change challenge. 
		Advanced economies like America should be taxed for more (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/africa-suffers-disproportionately-climate-change#:~:text=Climate%20change%20and%20the%20diminishing,countries%2C%20according%20to%20the%20report.">long-term effects of climate change</a>)  on other regions like Africa.</p>

			<h3>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Strategy: Using Information Access Rhetoric to frame the conversation between America and 
					Africa and omit the regions described as Advanced Economies from the IMF data like Asia. In this case, advanced economies 
					were described as regions like America. This feeds into the climate change narrative in the Global 
					North versus the Global South.
				</li>
				<li>A darker red was used for African countries to allow users to focus on increasing rates in developing countries. 
					Spacing between years was smaller for viewers to easily see the transition between 1900s, early 2000s and late 2000s.
					The colors were the main focus. I wanted to capitalize on narrative visualization to guide/orient users to the bright red
					which amplifies the role of developed economies in the climate challenge rather than Africa.
				</li>
				<li>Annual greenhouse gas emissions were used rather than quarterly. Annual records were less sensitive to detailed changes and only gave room to focus on countries' 
					overall performance rather than nuanced changes over smaller periods. </li>
				<li>Here, years were based on three bins (1900s, Early 2000s (2000 - 2010) & Late 2000s (2010-2020)). This is a make the 20 year timeline more consumable </li>
				<li>The Beyonce image was a play on the song, America has a Problem. Using annotations like images reinforce the argument
					and using a relatable means like rebranding a song chorus makes it more consumable.
				</li>
				<li>The section on countries lacking coping capacity was also used to strengthen the argument. The circles responded to the 
					number size. Red was still used as a color to illustrate danger/a problem. Here, the section is intended to show users African
					countries are at a disadvantage with coping mechanisms despite their low GHG annual emmissions.
				</li>
				<li>A pie chart of 3 African countries and Africa as a region was also used to build the argument on high GHG emissions in the US.
				</li>
				<li>Using mapping rhetoric with red points illustrating areas of danger to build on framing the larger contributor versus the areas of high risk. Focuses users on developed countries as the main players in this global challenge.</li>
				<li>Adding the link was an interactive way to get readers to do further research that strengthens the argument (same tactic used the second image)</li>

	<p>SCORING: -1 (slightly deceptive because readers are not provided a full view of the dataset by countries. The header also frames the discussion before the reader can make a self-assessment). </p>

    <section>
      <h2>AGAINST the Proposition</h2>

	  <p>
		African countries have less than 20% of forest cover- forest cover is attributed to a larger GHG absorption. 
	</p>

	<p>Poor climate investment in building green assets influences (<a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/forests-and-climate-change#:~:text=Cutting%20down%20or%20burning%20forests,emissions%20have%20come%20from%20deforestation.&text=Deforestation%20can%20also%20have%20more%20local%20climate%20impacts.">long-term climate risk</a>), not the GHG emissions of developed countries.</p>

			<h3>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>To frame this argument, I foused on land cover accounts provided in the data set (description provided in the table above). The first step was using the power of annotations through icons to illustrate decreasing forest cover. As (Hullman & Diakopoulos, 2011)discussed, annotations are crucial in directing a user's attention to specific areas aligning with arguments. This additional context is provided while making use of the illustrative bars. </li>
				<li>The title shows the percentage of land versus vegetative cover in the last 10 years and also plays into using annotations for messaging that influences the reader's idea.
				</li>
				<li>Another method of influencing end-user perception was using green and red to mimic the concept of good and bad. The good is forest cover, and the bad is artificial covering found in most urban areas. This leads to the narrative of poor forest cover in developing regions like Africa as the main climate change issue rather than the initial argument. Using the red and grey in the last graph was also used in the same way, drawing readers to the drastically low numbers from Africa.
				</li>
				<li>Land cover results show 14 variables, but I only focus on forest and artificial cover (two comparable features used to explain urban heat island or flooding effects). This limits the information users interact with when the dataset provides information on mangroves, grassland, and inland water bodies, all variables that may influence climate effects.
				</li>
			</ul>

	<p>SCORING: -1 (I use the same design process as the initial argument here, hence similar scores. So, I ranked it the same as the first visualization. </p>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

	  <h3>What was straightforward or difficult? </h3>

      <p>The presentation of the data by the IMF made it easier to take a position and make an argument. 
		The description of countries, however, was surprising and I was not entirely sure about how to deal with consolidating the information. The problem eventually affected how I decided to present my data for this assignment. In a different scenario, merging all country information into regions would have been a more ethical approach on my part.
	</p>

	<p>It was also difficult thinking of a fun way to illustrate for a counter argument. I was already so invested in the narrative of my first visualization.</p>

	<h3>How do you now define “ethical analysis and visualization”? 
	</h3>
	<p>"Ethical analysis and visualization" refers to the practice of evaluating and employing visual representations of data in a manner that adheres to fairness, transparency, and accountability. 
		Without thinking through a counter-argument to my initial statement, I was biased toward the literature and lectures I have experienced on consumerism in the United States. That reality influenced my first statement and thinking through an opposing angle made it easy to think through a neutral analysis process with politically charged topics like climate change.</p>

	<h3>Bounds to distinguish “acceptable” persuasive choices vs. “misleading” visualizations
	</h3>

	<p>The framing intention of the designer should be clear to avoid misleading the audience. As (Hullman & Diakopoulos, 2011) highlighted in their study of rhetoric visualization, sometimes the conversation is not about the appropriateness of persuasion in design. 
	   However, the power of rhetorical techniques, like those explored in the visuals, calls for increased responsibility among designers to consider the possibly unintended effects their choices may have. Readers may not want to know other confounding
