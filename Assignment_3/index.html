			<h2>Overall Analysis Questions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Population of women in the 1900s in comparison to men</li>
				<li>Population growth between 1900s and 2000s by age between men and women and</li>
				<li>Increase or decrease in women’s age between the 1900s and 2000s</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The concept of a binned histogram inspired the sketch</li>
				<li>The goal was to have a visual showing what population was the most and least in a bin with ten age groups. For the first, it was women and men whose ages were greater than 65. 
					The next was for age groups equal to or greater than or equal to 45 but less than or equal to 65. The next was greater than or equal to 20, less than or equal to 40, and the last group was from 0 to less than or equal to 15. </li>
				<li>The rings alternate based on the group population; the first represents the least while the last represents the highest population. 
					If men/women are the least, the arrow is down; if either is larger, the arrow faces up. The summary shows which gender in the bin is larger. 
					Three out of four times, there were more men than women in the 1900s.</li>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The next sketch was inspired by age and looking outside the binned age data. The circle is divided into four sections (0-25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100). 
					It started as a sketch to illustrate if the population is aging or getting younger, so the walking cane was a symbol to demonstrate the concept. The message remained unchanged, but the idea became a clock-inspired finish. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Understanding increase and decrease between both years for women. 
					I observed the transition for both genders in the previous sketch and wanted to focus on a more longitudinal concept.</li>
				<li>The width of the lines illustrate the population difference relative to the previous age group. Here we see a continous
					increase in the difference between the 1900s and 2000s until women in their 30s. Meaning for age groups above 30, there 
				is a higher number in the 2000s compared to 1900s. For age groups 30 and below, there is not as large of a difference between their
				size between 1900s and 2000s.
			  </li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

	  <h3>Sketch 1: Pros and Cons</h3>
	  <ol>
		<li>Easy to illustrate binned data without using bar charts.</li>
		<li>Color contrast shows how the population size alternates, but focusing on each ring as they build up may not be easy.</li>
	 </ol>

	 <h3>Sketch 2: Pros and Cons</h3>
	  <ol>
		<li>Difficult to illustrate both years in one sketch. It felt like a cluster chart, but I needed the x and y axis to 
			make reading easier.
		</li>
		<li>This was a concise way to visualize growth between multiple variables (years and age)</li>
	 </ol>


      <p>
        For sketch 1, In another sketch, I would try to find a different way to reflect increase and decrease (I tried to do this with Sketch 2). 
		However, it is a quick and colorful way to visualize which sex had the highest count between groups. After completing sketch 2, I realized it may have been easier 
		to make the outer ring for increase rather than making it based on gender. Right now, you must focus on whether the arrow goes up or down for women. I also wished I had incorporated numbers showing population size, but It was challenging with all the information already provided.
      </p>

	  <p>
       Sketch 3 was the most straighforward representation. The length of the lines was an easier way to illustrate growth than colors.
	   Thickness would have also been an easy way to visualize growth between the two years. It started off that way, but length seemed
	   like a clearer illustration.</p>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
        I was focused on responding to the same questions, but I wanted to see all my sketches come into one graph.
		Gender was initially the color guide for the chart. It was simpler to view, but using age provided a level of detail
		I was curious about between the 1900s and 2000s. It was not just about seeing there were more men than women between
		both years, but how did age compare? Were there more older women or men from this dataset?
      </p>

	  <p>
        The population sum was used to show an incrememnt over 2 million. There was a wide range for population size, so selecting
		the marker was based on what fit the chart in a concise way. I do recognize that compared to showing percentages, it may be 
		harder for a reader to calculate the difference.
      </p>


      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The sketches made thinking about visualizing the bar chart easier. It was hard to use a new question after spending so much 
		time on the sketch. Maybe it also plays into attachment and bias with visualization. I found a story and wanted to stick with 
		the idea with each drawing. Truthfully, the sketches were a build up from the previous one. It started off with an interest on 
		the population of women and each one was a variation based on age and a comparison between gender.
